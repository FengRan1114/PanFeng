I am a Ph.D. student at the School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Southeast University, supervised by Prof. Bing Li. My research lies at the intersection of cryptography and distributed machine learning, with a primary focus on privacy-preserving federated learning. I am particularly interested in the design of secure protocols that provide formal security and correctness guarantees under privacy and decentralization constraints. My current work explores the use of cryptographic primitives such as zero-knowledge proofs and secure multiparty computation to address security and privacy challenges in distributed intelligent network environments.
